I run the PhD-level reading group with Professor [Jack Donnelly](https://jackdonnelly.org/), where we focus on recent, or foundational contributions to International Relations theory, and epistemology. \
The readings are typically based on “relational” approaches in International Relations, such as complex systems, practices, fields, and networks. However, we have also read work from other fields, such as [Cognitive Science](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195333213.001.0001/acprof-9780195333213). \
An emerging theme of the reading group is to take mechanisms seriously and be wary of reductionist approaches. (Although, Dr. Donnelly and I sometimes disagree on what this means in practice.)
